# [Portfolio]

## Overview

This is a first iteration of my personal portfolio, showcasing my projects and technical stack, in order to practice Angular and OOP. It is a work in progress, subject to change, and aims to have full mobile responsiveness.

## Description

**Live version**: available [here](https://lunaireflare.github.io/portfolio/).

This project presented the perfect opportunity to build a first version of my personal portfolio as well as dive into a new tech. The goal was to familiarise myself with the Angular framework, as well as with the concepts of Object-Oriented Programmation (OOP). I also wanted to give special attention to UI/UX and responsiveness, by providing a minimalistic, accessible and seamless experience regardless of the device.

While the project is a work in progress and is bound to change, several updates are planned short-term:

- General refactor by adding services (*good for practicing despite being a little overkill*)
- Improvement of accessibility via aria labels, roles, etc.
- Considered addition of individual project pages for more in-depth view of the projects, which will allow routing

### Features

- Full-size hero header
- Navigation bar with link anchoring
- Project grid with screenshots, description and useful links
- Contact section with socials

### Practiced Skills

- UI/UX design
- Responsiveness
- Object-Oriented Programmation (OOP)
- Tailwind classes, grid layout
